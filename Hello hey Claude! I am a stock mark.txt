Hello hey Claude! I am a stock market trader. I do intraday trading in the stock market in India. You know that trading is a very difficult profession and you need to be very disciplined when it comes to execution in the trading.

I want to create an app which will help me to remain disciplined and avoid blunders and keep me conscious when I am trading. So as part of that I want to develop an application where this application will help me in my trading journey in terms of making me conscious and aware of my discipline and risk management principles, make me conscious of my daily limits in terms of risk.

Every day when I open this app it should remind me of the focus, discipline, emotions, control that is needed while trading. Also this app should give me a provision interface where I can log my performance of the trading in terms of the daily profit, daily loss and any learnings I want to record. It should also show me a dashboard where my daily performance is highlighted as a card (green or red) if there's a profit or loss. And it should help me to track the complete month in terms of the display as cards.

So this is just starting thoughts so I want your help to plan this application which will help me to be a disciplined trader and remain consistent in my trading.
